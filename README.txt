How to run:
1) Extract this folder anywhere on your computer.
2) Open `index.html` in Chrome/Edge/Firefox.
   - Make sure you are **online** so Tailwind CDN can load.
3) Optionally deploy: drag this folder to Netlify or push to a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages.

If the page looks unstyled (plain text):
- Tailwind might be blocked by your network. Try a different network or temporarily disable strict adblockers.
- You can also replace the CDN with another one (unpkg) near the top of `index.html`:
  `<script src="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@3.4.10/dist/tailwind.min.js"></script>`
